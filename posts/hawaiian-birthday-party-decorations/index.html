Big ideas are what get people thinking and sparking new ideas. By definition, big ideas are those that are difficult or impossible to imagine, but which offer a great potential for solving a problem. They can come from anywhere, in any field, and can range from the small to the large. Here are some examples of big ideas:</p><ol><li><p>A new way to make money: This could be anything from starting a small business to developing a new technology.</p></li><li><p>A better way to care for your health: This could include things like finding a way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins or developing more effective medical treatments.</p></li><li><p>A new way of transportation: This could include anything from building an electric vehicle to creating a flying car.</p></li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://rosaiskara.github.io/tags/ideas-2022/>Ideas 2022</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://rosaiskara.github.io/posts/may-bulletin-board-ideas-for-preschool/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>May Bulletin Board Ideas For Preschool ~ Crafts,actvities And Worksheets For Preschool,toddler And Kindergarten</span></a>
