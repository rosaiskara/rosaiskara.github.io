Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:\nYou have to be willing to try something. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you. Your idea might not be original, but it’s more likely to work because it’s been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking. Your idea might be better than what’s currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn’t quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
